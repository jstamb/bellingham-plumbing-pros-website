                <h2>Beat the Bellingham Freeze: Preventing Frozen Pipes</h2>
<p>Hey Bellingham! Winter's coming, and that means one thing: potentially frozen pipes. Nobody wants to deal with burst pipes and a watery mess. Luckily, Bellingham Plumbing Pros are here to help you prepare. Let's dive into some easy ways to prevent frozen pipes before they become a problem.</p>

<h3>Why Do Pipes Freeze?</h3>
<p>When the temperature drops below freezing, the water inside your pipes can freeze. As water freezes, it expands. This expansion can put tremendous pressure on your pipes, causing them to crack or burst. And that, my friends, is where the real fun begins (said no one ever!).</p>

<h3>Easy Steps to Prevent Frozen Pipes</h3>
<p>Here are some simple things you can do to keep your pipes from freezing:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>Insulate Your Pipes:</b> This is probably the most effective thing you can do. Wrap exposed pipes in unheated areas like basements, crawl spaces, and attics with pipe insulation sleeves or heat tape. You can find these at most hardware stores around Bellingham.</li>
 <li><b>Let Faucets Drip:</b> When the temperature is especially low, let a small trickle of water run from your faucets, especially those on exterior walls. The constant movement of water can prevent it from freezing. It might seem wasteful, but it's cheaper than repairing burst pipes!</li>
 <li><b>Seal Cracks and Openings:</b> Cold air can sneak in through cracks in your foundation or around windows and doors. Seal these openings to keep the cold out and your pipes warmer.</li>
 <li><b>Open Cabinet Doors:</b> During extreme cold snaps, open cabinet doors under sinks to allow warm air to circulate around the pipes.</li>
 <li><b>Disconnect and Drain Outdoor Hoses:</b> Disconnect your garden hoses and drain them before the first freeze. Shut off the water supply to outside faucets and insulate them.</li>
 <li><b>Keep the Heat On:</b> Even if you're going away for a few days, keep your thermostat set to at least 55°F (13°C).</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to Do If Your Pipes Freeze</h3>
<p>If you suspect your pipes are frozen, don't panic! Here's what to do:</p>

<ol>
 <li><b>Turn Off the Water:</b> If a pipe bursts, immediately turn off the main water supply to your house to minimize damage.</li>
 <li><b>Thaw the Pipe Slowly:</b> Use a hairdryer, heat lamp, or wrap the pipe with warm towels. Never use an open flame!</li>
 <li><b>Call a Professional:</b> If you can't thaw the pipe yourself or if you suspect significant damage, call Bellingham Plumbing Pros. We're available 24/7 for emergency plumbing repairs.</li>
</ol>
