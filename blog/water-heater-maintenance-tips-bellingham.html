                <h2>Keep Your Water Hot: Bellingham Water Heater Maintenance Tips</h2>
<p>Hey Bellingham! Your water heater is one of the most important appliances in your home, quietly working away to provide you with hot showers, clean laundry, and sparkling dishes. But like any appliance, it needs regular maintenance to keep it running efficiently and prevent costly repairs. Bellingham Plumbing Pros is here to share some simple water heater maintenance tips to keep your water hot and your energy bills down.</p>

<h3>Why Water Heater Maintenance Matters</h3>
<p>Regular maintenance can extend the life of your water heater, improve its efficiency, and prevent unexpected breakdowns. Ignoring maintenance can lead to:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>Reduced Lifespan:</b> Mineral buildup and corrosion can shorten the lifespan of your water heater.</li>
 <li><b>Lower Efficiency:</b> Sediment buildup reduces the water heater's ability to heat water efficiently, leading to higher energy bills.</li>
 <li><b>Noisy Operation:</b> Sediment can cause rumbling or popping noises.</li>
 <li><b>Leaking or Bursting:</b> Corrosion can weaken the tank, leading to leaks or even a burst.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Easy Water Heater Maintenance Tips</h3>
<p>Here are some simple steps you can take to maintain your water heater:</p>

<ol>
 <li><b>Flush the Tank:</b> Sediment buildup is a common problem. Flush your water heater tank at least once a year to remove sediment. This will improve its efficiency and extend its lifespan. (Consult your owner's manual for instructions or call Bellingham Plumbing Pros for assistance.)</li>
 <li><b>Check the Anode Rod:</b> The anode rod protects the tank from corrosion. Have it inspected and replaced every few years. (Again, Bellingham Plumbing Pros can help with this!)</li>
 <li><b>Insulate the Tank:</b> If your water heater is located in an unheated area, insulate it with a water heater blanket to reduce heat loss and save energy.</li>
 <li><b>Adjust the Temperature:</b> Set your water heater temperature to 120°F (49°C). This is hot enough for most needs and helps prevent scalding.</li>
 <li><b>Check for Leaks:</b> Regularly inspect your water heater for leaks around the tank, connections, and pressure relief valve.</li>
</ol>

<h3>When to Call a Professional</h3>
<p>While some maintenance tasks are DIY-friendly, others require the expertise of a professional plumber. Call Bellingham Plumbing Pros if you notice any of the following:</p>
